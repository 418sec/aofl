# Web Components

Aofl-js provides the following commonly used components:

- [aofl-drawer]()
- [aofl-element]()
- [aofl-img]()
- [aofl-picture]()
- [aofl-source]()
- [aofl-select-list]()
- [aofl-list-option]()

Rather than including a more exhaustive list of common components we have provided building blocks that may be combined to create any number of complex components. For example, a select-list and drawer may be combined in several ways to create toggles, accordions, date pickers, etc.

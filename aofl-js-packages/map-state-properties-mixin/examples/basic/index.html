    <p>Here we have a component that when attached to dom set's the background color of it's parent based on a property in store</p>
    <p>Try clicking on update color first. You'll notice that nothing happens. This is Because the element isn't rendered yet.</p>
    <p>Now click on attach/detach and then click on update color. This time you will see the background color changing.</p>
